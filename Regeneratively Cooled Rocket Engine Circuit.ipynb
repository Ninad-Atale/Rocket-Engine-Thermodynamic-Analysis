    "## Summary and Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "A critical consideration in rocket engine design is the temperature of the combustion chamber walls. With an increase in the completeness of a combustion process comes an increase in heat production, and consequently an increase in temperature. To make the most of the rocket fuel and oxidizer, engineers aim to maximize the effectiveness of the combustion process; however, they are limited by the melting temperature of the combustion chamber material. The heat generated by the combustion process can melt through the combustion chamber walls if unregulated. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common solution is regenerative cooling wherein rocket fuel is used to cool the combustion chamber and simultaneously making the combustion process more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the engine’s effectiveness will be determined by the heat it wastes (loses to non-regenerative processes). First, a potential cooling circuit will be proposed, and a cooling goal will be identified for the engine. Next, a thermodynamic analysis will be carried out on the components of the system, with key assumptions stated along the way. Finally, the project will determine the optimal post-turbine fuel pressure to maximize thrust while satisfying the cooling goal for the proposed design."

    "## Background information \n",
    "Rocket engines work by combusting atomized fuel and oxygen in a combustion chamber to produce hot exhaust gases. These exhaust gases are accelerated through a nozzle and subsequently produce thrust<sup><a href=\"https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/rocket/TRCRocket/rocket_principles.html\">1</a></sup>. The 'nozzle' of a rocket typcially follows a converging-diverging design, wherein gases are first accelerated to Mach 1 in a nozzle and then passed through a diffuser since a diffuser at supersonic flows acts like a nozzle<sup><a href=\"https://www.engapplets.vt.edu/fluids/CDnozzle/cdinfo.html#:~:text=The%20flow%20accelerates%20out%20of,ambient%20as%20a%20subsonic%20jet.\">2</a></sup>. \n",

    "A schematic for a regeneratively cooled rocket engine circuit is shown in the image below:\n",

    "![Overall circuit diagram](images/OverallCircuit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ethanol is released at a constant temperature and pressure from the ethanol tank into a compressor, followed by the regenerator, where it takes up excess heat from the combustion chamber walls. Then, it passes through a turbine which powers the compressor. Next, it enters the combustion chamber where it is burned with liquid oxygen - also exiting its tank at a constant temperature and pressure. The exhaust gases exachange heat within the regenerator with unburned ethanol before being expelled through the nozzle. Within the engine, all the fluids pass between the different devices through appropriately-designed  tubing. Note that the atomizer and pressure regulators have been added for completeness and will be ignored in the overall analysis. At this point, some key assumptions emerge:\n",
    "* The oxygen and ethanol are delivered from the tanks at a constant temperature and pressure. The flow of both liquids can be assumed as steady-flow and there are no concerns of either 'running out'. Both fluids are 100% pure. \n",
    "* There are no pressure or temperature drops in any of the tubing. Concerns about the tubes melting are also neglected and it is assumed at the material of the tubing is able to withstand the maximum temperature and pressure. \n",
    "* Since we are analyzing an ideal rocket engine, the compressor, turbine and nozzle can be assumed to be isentropic. \n",
    "* The combustion products enter the nozzle at 0 velocity and exit at atmospheric pressure - essentially generating as much thrust as possible. \n",
    "                                                                                                                                     \n",
    "Similarly, we can determine some key assumptions/ values of some thermodynamic properties needed:\n",
    "* The ethanol enters the combustion chamber as a fluid (as per the problem statement). To further simplify, it will be approximated as a saturated liquid at the requisite temperature.\n",
    "* The oxygen enters the combustion chamber as a saturated liquid at the requisite temperature and pressure.  \n",
    "* Based on research<sup><a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20100033399/downloads/20100033399.pdf\">3</a></sup>, the pressure of the oxygen in the tank will be $243.1 kPa$ with an assumed quality of $0$. Therefore, the oxygen enters the combustion chamber directly with these properties.  \n",
    "* Based on research and reasoning, the temperature of the ethanol in the tank will be $-10 ^\\circ C$ and the pressure will be assumed as $1atm \\approx 101 kPa$. These values were assumed as follows: \n",
    "    * The flash point of pure ethanol is around $14 ^\\circ C$ at 1atm.<sup><a href=\"https://ehs.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/19-157-Ethanol-Fact-Sheet-v2-am-mu.pdf\">4</a></sup> Since it is a liquid at this pressure, there is no need to cool it excessively and no need to pressurize it beyond $101 kPa$ in the tanks themselves. \n",
    "    * Therefore, to ensure safety while maintaining efficiency, the ethanol in the tank will be maintained at $-10 ^\\circ C$ so that it doesn't ignite. \n",
    "* Based on research, the initial guess for pressure of the ethanol entering the combustion chamber will be $1.5 MPa$.<sup><a href=\"https://gjar.org/publishpaper/vol2issue1/d86r80.pdf\">5</a></sup>. We will later vary this value.\n",
    "* Since ethanol combustion does not reach excessively high temperatures, the combustion chamber will be made of aluminium-6061 (a common aluminium alloy, which, on average, has a melting point of $617 ^\\circ C$.<sup><a href=\"https://asm.matweb.com/search/specificmaterial.asp?bassnum=ma6061t6\">6</a></sup> Therefore, the temperature of the exhaust gases after the regenerator is assumed to be $586.15 ^\\circ C$ (95% of the melting temperature of aluminium 6061, allowing for a safety factor of 5%).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_A note about the way the regenerator is modelled: In reality, the regenerator is connected directly to the combustion chamber - that is the regeneration process and combustion process happen simultaneously. Therefore we assume that all the heat generated by the combustion is transferred through the regenerator to the fuel as the combustion process is happening. Any excess heat will need to be removed by means other than the regenerator and thus represents inefficiency. Therefore, we want to reduce this excess heat which is not taken by the fueL._"

    "Clearly, we see that the ethanol cannot take up all the lost heat from the combustion chamber at 1.5MPa post-turbine pressure, implying that another cooling method will be needed to take away the extra heat. This adds weight to the rocket and therefore implies inefficiency. Therefore, as per our optimization problem we must modify the post-turbine pressure to see if we can reduce the 'wasted heat' from the combustion chamber. An ideal case will be when the heat loss from the combustion chamber is exactly matched by the maximum heat that the ethanol can take up. Note that in the case when q_max_regenerator is more than the q_dot_out_test (from the last cell), we have heat flow into the combustion gases which again would require additional cooling. Therefore, we want to find the pressure where the absolute value of (q_dot_out - q_max_regenerator) = 0. "

    "## Conclusions \n",
    "\n",
    "As the plot in the previous cell shows, increasing the pressure after the turbine generally leads to less heat loss with diminishing returns. An increased pressure will require more sturdy tubing which once again adds weight. If the pressure is too high, there is still heat loss - in the reverse direction this time as the plot shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the state before the nozzle is fully defined since the enthalpies of the ideal exhaust gases only depends on temperature (which we have fixed). Similarly, the state after the nozzle is fully defined using the atmospheric pressure and the fact that the entropy at the exit is the same as the entropy at the inlet. Therefore the thrust produced is always the same and a pressure that minimizes weight will be preferred (we are not changing the mass flow rates of the fuel or oxidiser). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we conclude that the more the pressure of the fuel entering the combustion chamber, the greater the altitude that the rocket will reach. As a result, a pressure of ~4Mpa after the turbine allows the rocket to reach the greatest altitude in this design (assuming that the additional weight required to sustain the higher pressure is negligible and considering a mass flow rate of 1kg/s of ethanol). At this pressure, the heat loss is nearly 0. "
