## Overview
This project performs a thermodynamic analysis of a regeneratively cooled rocket engine. The goal is to maximize the effectiveness of the combustion process while managing the heat generated by the combustion chamber walls. The analysis proposes a cooling circuit using Ethanol as the fuel and Liquid Oxygen as the oxidizer, where the fuel is used to cool the combustion chamber before combustion.

## Project Structure
- `Regeneratively Cooled Rocket Engine Circuit.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the thermodynamic analysis, calculations, and optimization.
- `images/`: Directory containing circuit diagrams used in the notebook.

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you need the following Python libraries:
- `matplotlib`
- `CoolProp`

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install matplotlib CoolProp
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Regeneratively Cooled Rocket Engine Circuit.ipynb"
   ```
4. Run all cells to execute the analysis and generate the plots.

## Methodology
The project models the thermodynamic process of the engine components:
1.  **Compressor & Turbine**: Analyzed as isentropic devices. The turbine powers the compressor using the expanded fuel.
2.  **Combustion Chamber**: Models the stoichiometric combustion of Ethanol and Oxygen.
3.  **Regenerator**: Models the heat exchange between the combustion chamber walls and the fuel.

## Key Findings
The analysis determines the optimal post-turbine fuel pressure to maximize thrust while satisfying cooling goals.
-   **Conclusion**: A post-turbine pressure of approximately **4 MPa** allows the rocket to reach the greatest altitude (maximizing thrust) while minimizing heat loss (nearly 0 heat loss at this pressure).
